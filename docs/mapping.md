# About our maps

EveryPolitician uses maps to help you navigate political data by territory. However, representing the world on a map involves choices that can never fully capture political reality.

## Our map data

Our maps are based on [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/), a public domain dataset widely used for cartographic purposes. Natural Earth provides country boundaries that generally follow internationally recognised borders, but this doesn't mean these boundaries are universally accepted or uncontested.

## Why reality is more complicated

Political geography is complex for many reasons:

- **Disputed territories**: Many regions are claimed by multiple states, or their status is contested internationally
- **De facto vs de jure control**: The entity that actually governs a territory may differ from the entity that is internationally recognised as sovereign
- **Changing boundaries**: Borders change over time through treaties, conflicts, and political processes
- **Non-state territories**: Dependencies, overseas territories, and other entities don't fit neatly into a simple country map

## Our approach

We aim to be as inclusive as possible when tracking political positions. Our database includes:

- Positions in internationally recognised states
- Positions in territories with de facto self-governance
- Subnational positions at regional and local levels

When you use our maps, keep in mind that the boundaries shown are one conventional representation. We encourage you to explore our data for any territory that interests you, regardless of how it appears on the map.
