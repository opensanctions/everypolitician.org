# Methodology

This page explains how EveryPolitician collects, organises, and maintains data about political office-holders.

## Data sources

We collect data from several types of sources:

- **Official government websites**: Parliamentary member lists, cabinet announcements, and judicial appointments
- **International databases**: Global databases of world leaders and heads of state
- **Wikidata**: Community-maintained structured data from the Wikimedia ecosystem

All sources are [documented on our data sources page](/datasets/).

## Types

We track several categories of political positions:

### National level

- **Executive**: Heads of state, heads of government, cabinet ministers, senior civil servants
- **Legislative**: Members of parliament, senators, representatives
- **Judicial**: Supreme court judges, constitutional court members

### Subnational level

- **Regional executives**: Governors, premiers, chief ministers
- **Regional legislators**: State parliament members, provincial councillors
- **Local government**: Mayors, city council members

### Other roles

- **State enterprises**: Executives of major state-owned companies
- **International bodies**: Representatives to international organisations

## Position status

For each position, we track whether it is currently occupied and by whom. Positions can have one of several statuses:

- **Current**: The person currently holds this position
- **Past**: The person previously held this position
- **Unclear**: We lack precise dates to determine current status

The "unclear" status occurs when our data sources indicate someone holds or held a position, but don't provide clear start and end dates. We're working to improve date coverage over time.

## Updates and accuracy

Data is updated automatically when our sources change. For Wikidata-sourced information, updates typically appear within a few days of edits being made.

If you spot an error, the best way to fix it is to [contribute a correction](/docs/contribute/).
