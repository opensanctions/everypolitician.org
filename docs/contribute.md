# Contribute

EveryPolitician is a community project, and we welcome contributions from anyone who wants to help improve coverage of political data.

## Edit politician profiles on Wikidata

The most impactful way to contribute is through [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/), the structured data project behind Wikipedia. Changes you make there flow into EveryPolitician within a few days.

### Getting started with Wikidata

1. Create a Wikidata account (or use your Wikipedia login)
2. Find a politician's Wikidata item by searching their name
3. Add or correct information using Wikidata's editing interface

### WikiProject Every Politician

The [WikiProject Every Politician](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_every_politician) coordinates efforts to improve political data on Wikidata. It provides:

- Guidelines for how to structure political data
- The [political data model](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_every_politician/Political_data_model) explaining how positions and occupancies work
- Lists of positions that need data

## Build a data crawler

If you're technically inclined, you can help by writing crawlers that automatically collect data from official sources.

Our crawlers are [open source](https://github.com/opensanctions/opensanctions/tree/main/datasets) and use the zavod framework (Python). Resources to get started:

- [Crawler writing tutorial](https://zavod.opensanctions.org/tutorial/)
- [Data source wishlist](https://bit.ly/osa-sources) for inspiration

## Report issues

If you find incorrect data but can't fix it yourself, you can:

- Open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/opensanctions/opensanctions/issues)
- [Contact us](/contact/) directly

Please include as much detail as possible, including links to official sources that show the correct information.
