# About EveryPolitician

EveryPolitician is a community-driven project to create a comprehensive, freely accessible database of political office-holders around the world.

## Our mission

We believe that information about who holds political power should be available to everyone. Whether you're a journalist investigating public officials, a researcher studying political systems, or a citizen learning about your representatives, you should be able to find accurate, up-to-date information easily.

## What we cover

We track political office-holders across a wide range of roles:

- Heads of state and government
- Cabinet ministers and senior officials
- Members of parliament and legislative bodies
- Judges and judicial officials
- Regional and local government leaders
- Executives of state-owned enterprises

## How it works

EveryPolitician brings together data from official government sources, international databases, and community contributions through [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). It's a project of [OpenSanctions](https://opensanctions.org), using the same data infrastructure and collection tools.

## History

The original EveryPolitician project was created by [mySociety](https://www.mysociety.org/) to support civic technology projects worldwide. This new iteration builds on that foundation, expanding coverage and improving data quality through automated collection and community collaboration.

## Get involved

EveryPolitician is only as good as its contributors. See our [contribution guide](/docs/contribute/) to learn how you can help improve the data.
