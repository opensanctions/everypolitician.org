# everypolitician.org

[EveryPolitician](https://everypolitician.org/) is a global database of political office-holders — from heads of state and parliamentarians to judges and senior officials — across 261 countries and territories. It is a project of [OpenSanctions](https://www.opensanctions.org/).

Understanding who holds power is fundamental to accountability. The information on public officials is often scattered and hard to find; EveryPolitician aims to be a single, open, and maintained source for it.

The data is sourced primarily from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/), supplemented by government sources and community contributions. It is freely accessible for journalists and researchers, and available for commercial licensing as part of OpenSanctions' [Politically Exposed Persons (PEP) dataset](https://www.opensanctions.org/pep/).

This repository contains the source code for the everypolitician.org website.

## Contributing data

The best way to improve the data is to edit [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) directly. We also maintain [PoliLoom](https://github.com/opensanctions/poliloom), a tool that semi-automatically extracts political data from the web and lets contributors review and submit it to Wikidata.

See [everypolitician.org/about/contribute](https://everypolitician.org/about/contribute/) for more.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
